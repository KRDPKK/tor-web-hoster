# ONIONHOST

ONIONHOST is a Windows Forms app to host Tor hidden services easily on your machine. It downloads and runs Tor, manages onion addresses, and lets you pick service templates.

## Features

- Auto-download and setup of Tor
- Start/stop Tor hidden services with onion address display
- Tabbed UI with service template selection
- Templates include:
  - Anonymous Chat System
  - Anonymous File Sharing Platform

## Usage

1. Start the app.
2. In **Tor Status** tab, click **Start Hosting** to launch Tor and create a hidden service.
3. The onion address will show when ready.
4. Switch to **Templates** tab to select a service template.
5. Click **Deploy Template** to get instructions.

> **Note:** The template is easy to use but not fully made — it’s like halfsies done. Just run `app.py` and make sure you have Flask installed :)

## Requirements

- Windows 8 or later
- Internet for downloading Tor initially
- Python Flask environment for running templates
